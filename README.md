# ColladaRender

OpenGL COLLADA File viewer in C#

## Features:

 - Drag and drop .DAE files (after pressing "F") to load them
 - Registerable Input functions

This was my summer project of 2021 where I learned a ton about the rendering pipeline.
**I am continuing it here in 2022 to add more robustness after working in Unity and seeing all the cool features they have.**


I had originally planned to convert this to use the Vulkan API, but this is meant to be more of a proof of concept viewing application rather than a showcase of Vulkan API knowledge (see my upcoming VulkanSandbox repo for my boilerplate Vulkan rendering engine).

That being said though, I hope to add different file format support and more advanced rendering techniques to make the models look nice.
